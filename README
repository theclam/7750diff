7750diff v0.7 Beta
Written by Foeh Mannay, March 2013

PURPOSE
=======

7750diff is a (semi-) hierarchy-aware tool for comparing 7750 configuration files / fragments. It dumps out differences between configs along with the "parent" context entries within which the changes were found.

Please see http://networkingbodges.blogspot.com/ for more information on the theory behind this.

INSTALLATION
============

For the Windows binary, just put it somewhere within your PATH or run it from the current directory.

To compile from source, just run gcc against it. There are no dependancies above the standard C libraries.

USAGE
=====

Simply run 7750diff and provide the names of the two configuration files you want to compare, for example:

D:\7750diff>7750diff a.cfg b.cfg
Unique to a.cfg:
configure
    qos
        scheduler-policy "20000kbps" create
            description "20000kbps Scheduler"
            tier 1
                scheduler "tier1" create
                    rate 20000 cir 20000
                exit
            exit
        exit
    exit
exit
Unique to b.cfg:
configure
    qos
        scheduler-policy "25000kbps" create
            description "25000kbps Scheduler"
            tier 1
                scheduler "tier1" create
                    rate 25000 cir 25000
                exit
            exit
        exit
        scheduler-policy "40000kbps" create
            description "40000kbps Scheduler"
            tier 1
                scheduler "tier1" create
                    rate 40000 cir 40000
                exit
            exit
        exit
    exit
exit

D:\7750diff>

If you would only like to see the configuration elements unique to the first or second file, use "-first" or "-second" respectively.
